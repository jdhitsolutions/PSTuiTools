These commands are designed to be run in the traditional PowerShell console and should run cross-platform, where the underlying PowerShell commands, e.g. `Get-Service`, is supported.

You are welcome to use the source code as reference material for your own projects.

Run `Get-PSTuiTools` to see a list of available commands.
